          Hannanth Digital India Private Limited: Pioneering Compassionate

          Today, customer empowerment is the new norm, thanks to the digital
          revolution. Hannanth Digital India Private Limited understands that
          customer experience is paramount, especially during challenging times
          like the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis has compelled us to redefine
          customer care for the emerging New Normal.

              Customer interactions now have a profound and lasting impact on
              their trust and loyalty. As people face uncertainty and isolation,
              their measure of a business's value increasingly lies in how it
              adapts to serve their evolving needs with compassion and humanity.

              Now more than ever, business leaders must anticipate long-term
              changes in consumer behavior triggered by this crisis. Customer
              relationships revolve around strategies for acquiring and
              retaining customers, with the ultimate goal of creating mutual
              value. In the post-pandemic world, organizations like Hannanth
              Digital India must rethink and redesign strategies to engage
              customers with empathy and sincerity, maintaining trust and
              loyalty for continued business, even with limited staff
              availability.

              Staying attuned to shifting customer preferences and innovating
              customer journeys is crucial. A "less touch" approach, already
              successful in e-commerce, alongside digital customer journeys,
              data-driven initiatives, and social media engagement, will pave
              the way forward.

          At Hannanth Digital India, we prioritize the well-being of our team,
          setting an example for customer treatment. With the lockdown, we
          swiftly transitioned to remote work. Our internal digital adaptation
          was not just a change; it was an experience that shaped our customer
          engagement strategies, resulting in superior customer experiences.

              When the crisis hit, our focus wasn't on market share or revenue,
              but on meaningful support for our retailers and customers. In our
              business, serving the underbanked and underinsured is crucial.
              During a crisis, customers seek understanding, and they are highly
              sensitive to the tone and intent of communication.

              We've witnessed many customers, including migrant workers, lose
              their jobs during the pandemic. In response, we initiated
              "JobsNearby," a platform connecting job seekers with relevant
              opportunities, exemplifying our commitment to our community.

              Hannanth Digital India believes that digital experiences that meet
              customers where they are will continue to thrive post-pandemic,
              providing a competitive business edge. Listening to customers is
              essential; in the digital age, they can easily switch brands in
              search of convenience. Our feedback mechanisms for products are
              more than a tool; they are a commitment to continuous improvement
              and better customer experiences.

              The old mindset of 'take it or leave it' has no place in today's
              market, where customers are spoiled for choice. That's why
              offering an exceptional experience is criticalâ€”it's what makes
              customers choose Hannanth Digital India over others. We believe
              the COVID-19 crisis will eventually pass, but the shift in
              consumer behavior is here to stay. Digital engagement, once a
              secondary consideration, is now at the forefront of business
              strategy. The battle ahead will be fought on the grounds of
              customer experience. In the "Next Normal," empathy-infused
              customer experiences will be the key differentiator for businesses
              worldwide.
