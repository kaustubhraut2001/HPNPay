          Hannanth Digital India Private Limited's Mission to Transform Kiranas
          for Tomorrow

          India's retail domain is evolving rapidly, with both global and local
          retail giants vying for consumer attention. Despite the allure of
          large, modern supermarkets, kirana stores—small, neighborhood grocery
          outlets—remain the backbone of India's consumer goods market,
          accounting for a substantial share.

              Kirana stores have undergone significant changes in recent years.
              The rise of e-commerce and the entry of multinational online
              retailers, offering a plethora of convenient payment and delivery
              options, have tested the resilience of these local shops. Yet, the
              strength of Kirana stores has been reaffirmed during the global
              pandemic.

              Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, these traditional stores have
              become pillars of community support, exemplifying the essence of
              last-mile connectivity by fulfilling Bharat’s everyday needs. When
              movement restrictions hampered larger e-commerce entities, kirana
              stores emerged as unsung heroes, ensuring a steady supply of
              essentials. They also became critical digital financial service
              points amidst restricted banking operations.

              Many Kirana stores gained new patrons during the lockdown, but
              there remains a significant number that requires technological
              advancements to meet growing demands. Hannanth Digital India
              Private Limited, under the HPNPAY brand, is at the forefront of
              this transformation, making Kiranas future-ready. Through
              technology, HPNPAY is converting kiranas into hyper-local banks,
